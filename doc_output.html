</p>
<h3>
 Employers must offer and pay TFWs the higher of:
</h3>
<h4>
 <strong>
  Same wages as existing employees
 </strong>
</h4>
<p>
 The wages the employer pays its domestic employees for the same job, work location and with similar skills and years of experience;
</p>
<h4>
 If no comparable position exists in your organization
</h4>
<p>
 If no comparable position exists in your organization, employers must pay workers at least the median wage according to the position’s National Occupational Classification (
 <a href="https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA" target="_blank">
