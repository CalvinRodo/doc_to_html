 Progress reviews\xa0
</h2>
<p>
 Each year,\xa0Service\xa0Canada\xa0will conduct progress reviews to assess how well employers are meeting the commitments detailed in your LMBP. The annual reviews are employers\u2019 opportunity to report on the progress that the company is making in creating lasting, positive impacts on the Canadian\xa0labour\xa0market.\xa0
</p>
<p>
 Cooperating with\xa0 Service Canada\xa0throughout the review process is important. Employers must provide\xa0supporting documentation\xa0to\xa0remain eligible. You must keep your records for\u202f
 <strong>
  six full years
 </strong>
 \u202ffor audit purposes.\xa0
</p>
<summary>
 If\xa0you\xa0do not make reasonable efforts to meet your LMBP commitments\xa0
</summary>
<p>
 If\xa0you\xa0do not make reasonable efforts to meet your LMBP commitments, or complete your Progress Review within the requested timeframe, you risk receiving a negative decision on future GTS applications. Your LMBP\u2019s assessment will not impact your eligibility to other program streams.\xa0
</p>
<p>
 You are accountable for the benefits in your LMBP even if a TFW you hire under the GTS becomes a permanent resident of Canada while working in your organization.\xa0
</p>

<summary>
 How review dates are determined\xa0
</summary>
<p>
 Your first LMBP review will occur\xa0approximately\xa01 year after you sign your LMBP.\xa0\xa0
</p>
<p>
 The review date does not change:\xa0
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  If you\xa0make changes or amend your LMBP\xa0
 </li>
 <li>
  If you\xa0hire additional TFWs\xa0

 Making changes to the LMBP\xa0
</h2>
<p>
 Employers\xa0who have\xa0an approved LMBP and apply for additional TFW positions\xa0through the\xa0GTS,\xa0\xa0will\xa0not have to submit a new LMBP, however,\xa0 Service Canada\xa0will review your existing plan as a result.\xa0
</p>
<summary>
 If an employer requires additional TFW\xa0positions\xa0
</summary>
<p>
 As part of this review, Service Canada\xa0may request an update on your commitments to date in the LMBP. We may also request that you amend or expand existing commitments to reflect a request for additional TFWs. This helps to make sure that returning employers to the GTS continue to provide positive lasting benefits for Canadian workers.\xa0
</p>
<details>
 end
</details>
<h3>
 Forecasting commitments\xa0
</h3>
<p>
 If you anticipate the need to apply for additional TFW\xa0positions over a 12-month period, the forecasted number of TFW positions\xa0may be included\xa0in your LMBP, providing\xa0the commitments\xa0support\xa0the anticipated number. If you and Service Canada\xa0officials agree to use this model, you may not have to update your LMBP each time you return to the GTS until your forecast is met\xa0or your commitments have expired (whichever comes first).\xa0\xa0
