To ensure that your LMBP does this, you must work with Service Canada to: </p><ul><li>develop activities to meet commitments </li><li>identify commitments, and </li><li>track the progress of commitments </li></ul><h2>What to include in an LMBP </h2><p>LMBP commitments are split into two categories: </p><ul><li>1 mandatory benefit </li><li>At least 2 complementary benefits </li></ul><p>Service Canada will work with employers to complete the LMBP during the Global Talent Stream (GTS) application process. </p><h3>Identify the mandatory benefit </h3><p>For the mandatory benefit(s) in their LMBP, every employer under the GTS must identify at least 1 activity that will support their achievement of the benefit. </p><p>The employer must also identify at least 2 complementary benefits for which they are committing to achieving as part of their LMBP. The complementary benefits identified by an employer in their plan <strong>cannot be the same</strong> as the mandatory benefit identified.  </p><summary>Category A of the GTS </summary><p>Employers must commit to<strong> job creation for Canadians and permanent residents</strong> as your mandatory benefit. For this benefit, employers will need to track the number of jobs either directly connected to the temporary foreign worker (TFW) hired or the overall job growth within the company. </p><summary>Example: </summary><p>Activities to support this benefit could include, but are not limited to: </p><ul><li>Hiring additional Canadians and permanent residents to support the foreign worker in their role; and </li><li>Increasing the number of Canadians or permanent residents employed full-time and part-time by the employer </li></ul><details>end</details><details>end</details><summary>Category B of the GTS </summary><p>Employers must commit to investments<strong> in skills and training for Canadians and permanent residents as your mandatory benefit</strong>.  </p><summary>Example </summary><p>Activities to support this benefit could include, but are not limited to: </p><ul><li>Increasing financial investments in internal skills and training. </li><li>Establishing partnerships with post-secondary institutes or other organizations to support skills and training.

For example, this could include supporting employees to travel to and attend industry or industry sector conferences relevant to the development of their specialized skillset. </li></ul><details>end</details><summary>Increasing diversity in the workplace </summary><p>Increase in diversity by developing, implementing, or participating in initiatives that increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the workplace.

The annual reviews are employers’ opportunity to report on the progress that the company is making in creating lasting, positive impacts on the Canadian labour market. </p><p>Cooperating with <s>ESDC </s>Service Canada throughout the review process is important. Employers must provide supporting documentation to remain eligible. You must keep your records for <strong>six full years</strong> for audit purposes. </p><summary>If you do not make reasonable efforts to meet your LMBP commitments </summary><p>If you do not make reasonable efforts to meet your LMBP commitments, or complete your Progress Review within the requested timeframe, you risk receiving a negative decision on future GTS applications. Your LMBP’s assessment will not impact your eligibility to other program streams. </p><p>You are accountable for the benefits in your LMBP even if a TFW you hire under the GTS becomes a permanent resident of Canada while working in your organization. </p><details>end</details><summary>How review dates are determined </summary><p>Your first LMBP review will occur approximately 1 year after you sign your LMBP.  </p><p>The review date does not change: </p><ul><li>If you make changes or amend your LMBP </li><li>If you hire additional TFWs </li><li>When your TFW is issued a work permit </li></ul><details>end</details><h2>Making changes to the LMBP </h2><p>Employers who have an approved LMBP and apply for additional TFW positions through the GTS,  will not have to submit a new LMBP, however,  Service Canada will review your existing plan as a result. </p><summary>If an employer requires additional TFW positions </summary><p>As part of this review, Service Canada may request an update on your commitments to date in the LMBP. We may also request that you amend or expand existing commitments to reflect a request for additional TFWs. This helps to make sure that returning employers to the GTS continue to provide positive lasting benefits for Canadian workers. </p><details>end</details><h3>Forecasting commitments </h3><p>If you anticipate the need to apply for additional TFW positions over a 12-month period, the forecasted number of TFW positions may be included in your LMBP, providing the commitments support the anticipated number. If you and Service Canada officials agree to use this model, you may not have to update your LMBP each time you return to the GTS until your forecast is met or your commitments have expired (whichever comes first).  </p><section class="alert-info"><h2>Note</h2></section><alert><p>This applies only to the LMBP element of the application process. You must still apply each time you wish to access the GTS. </p></alert>
