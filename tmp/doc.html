Because a beneficiary cannot have more than one\xa0RDSP, a transfer request must be completed to move a plan from one financial organization to another. The transfer must be for the full amount existing in the plan. Partial amounts cannot be transferred. The holder of the plan must initiate the transfer and have the required form completed by both financial organizations.</p><p>To request the transfer of an\xa0RDSP\xa0from one financial organization to another or to revoke a request for payments of the Grant and/or the Bond, complete the following forms:</p><ul><li><a href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=EMP5611">Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) Transfer</a></li><li><a href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=EMP5490">Revocation of Request for Canada Disability Savings Grants and/or Canada Disability Savings Bonds</a></li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong>\xa0Financial organizations may have certain conditions and fees associated with transferring an\xa0RDSP.

Anyone with written permission from the Plan holder may contribute to the RDSP again, until December 31 of the year the beneficiary turns 59. The beneficiary may also be eligible to receive Grants and Bonds again, until December 31 of the year they turn 49.</p><p>For more information about losing DTC approval and how this affects the RDSP, see\xa0<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-disability-savings-plan-rdsp/cessation-disability-death-a-beneficiary.html">Cessation of disability or death of a beneficiary</a>\xa0or call 1-800-959-8281 (TTY users call 1-800-665-0354).</p><h3>Accessing savings from a RDSP while the beneficiary is not DTC-approved</h3><p>Beneficiaries who do not regain DTC approval must start withdrawing from the RDSP starting in the calendar year they turn 60. However, if their Plan is closed, the beneficiary dies, or a withdrawal is made before that time, part or all of the Grants and Bonds in the RDSP must be repaid to the Government. The amount of Grant and Bond that is subject to repayment depends on the beneficiary\u2019s age and when they lost DTC approval. If the beneficiary is:</p><summary>49 years of age or younger by the end of the calendar year</summary><p>All Grants and Bonds paid into the RDSP in the 10 years before the beneficiary lost DTC approval are subject to repayment in the event of Plan closure, the beneficiary\u2019s death, or a withdrawal.</p><details>end</details><summary>Between 50 and 59 years of age by the end of the calendar year and lost DTC approval before the year they turned 50</summary><p>Initially, all Grants and Bonds paid into the RDSP in the 10 years before the beneficiary lost DTC approval are subject to repayment. For each year that the beneficiary is over the age of 50, this 10-year reference period decreases by a year.</p><p>For example, in the year the beneficiary turns 51, the Grants and Bonds paid into the RDSP in the 9 years before they lost DTC approval are subject to repayment in the event of Plan closure, the beneficiary\u2019s death, or a withdrawal.</p><details>end</details><summary>Between 50 and 59 years of age by the end of the calendar year and lost DTC approval in or after the year they turned 50</summary><p>All Grants and Bonds paid into the RDSP in the 10 years before January 1 of the year in which the Plan is closed, the beneficiary dies, or the withdrawal is made, are subject to repayment in the event of Plan closure, the beneficiary\u2019s death, or a withdrawal.</p><details>end</details><summary>60 years of age or older by the end of the calendar year</summary><p>None of the Grants and Bonds paid into the RDSP are subject to repayment in the event of Plan closure, the beneficiary\u2019s death, or a withdrawal.</p><details>end</details><nav class="next"><a href="file:///C:\\CDSP-subway-proto-resources.html">Next\xa0: Publication and resources for issuers</a></nav>
